by Svetozar Valchev
for the SoftUni's JS Web module project assignment on Angular framework
GitHub repository: https://github.com/snowstormBG/dota-angular-project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.3.

The project is intended to mimic the Dota 2 game client's user interface.
It's connected to a remote DB/Back-end using Kinvey.

Currently implemented:
--Public section where newcomers can register and then log into their account.
--Public news section, available without authentication.
--Logged in users have access to:
----a navigation bar
----the main Dota dashboard
----the section where all the heroes are listed
----a section that lists all the ingame items

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
